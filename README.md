# AI Car

I started this project because I wanted to learn a little about AI

It isn't perfect, but I attempted to implement a neural network that learns how to drive a car around a race track

The code that I wrote was inspired from these sources:

- Max on Tech youtube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30AETbxgR-fAJaytLh4vAWCxTAUCrHO4

- Sebastian Lague youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c
