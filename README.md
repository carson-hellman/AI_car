# AI Car

I started this project because I wanted to learn a little about AI.

The code is far from perfect, but I attempted to implement a neural network that learns how to drive a car around a race track.

There are currently issues with the network getting stuck in local minimums, but for now I am happy with the progress I have made.

The code that I wrote was inspired from these sources:
